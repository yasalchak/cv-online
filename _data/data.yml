# Experience
experience:
  - role: Research Assistant (full-time)
    time: 2022- Present
    company: Griffith University Centre of Biomedical and Rehabilitation Engineering (Gold Coast, QLD, Australia)
    details: |
      The objective of the project is to create a wearable sensor system integrated into a textile garment, enabling the acquisition of biological data. The system includes surface electromyography (EMG) sensors to monitor muscle activation during movement as well as inertial measurement units (IMUs) placed on anatomical landmarks to track motion.<br>This solution will allow biomechanical data to be collected in any environment, which could prove useful for rehabilitation with motor disorders, neuromuscular conditions, or injuries. Some of the obtained results were published in IEEE Sensors journal [1] <br>
    technologies_used: |
      MATLAB®, C/C++, Visual Studio, Altium Designer®, Telemetry Viewer, VICON motion capture  system, Myon EMG and IMU wireless sensors, Electric circuits bench testing equipment <br>
     
 
  - role: PhD Student (full-time)
    time: 2018-2022
    company: Griffith University (Brisbane, QLD, Australia)
    details: |
      The project involved development of an EM field propagation model for in-body to on-body wireless communication channel. <br> The validation included numericall modelling and in-vivo experiments on laboratory animals. An implanted transmitter and wearable antennas were used for the data acquisition. The validated model was implemented for 3D positioning of a wireless endoscopy capsule based on RSSI analysis. Publications made within this project included in the end of this document under numbers: [2-11] <br>
    technologies_used: | 
      MATLAB®, CST MICROWAVE STUDIO®, Python, VNA, RF Spectrum Analyser, Dream Catcher ME1310 (Radiation Pattern Software), Ultrasound imaging software <br>

  - role: Tutor for Calculus II (casual)
    time: 2019-2020
    company: Griffith University (Brisbane, QLD, Australia)
    details: |
      I was responsible for the tutorials within the Calculus II course, including vector analysis and differential equations. I taught 2-year Bachelor students with multidisciplinary backgrounds.

    time: 2015-2018
    company: Tomsk Open Laboratory for Material Inspection (TOLMI), Institute of Nondestructive Testing (NDT), National Research Tomsk Polytechnic University (TPU), Russia
    details: |
     Main research work included development of ultrasonic testing methodologies for quality assurance of steel components with welding; perfomance validation of acoustic systems and methodologies for defect position and dimensions evaluation;
     implementation of algorithms for acoustic data visualisation and 3D image reconstruction of welding defects based on digitally focused array (DFA) technology. <br>

      MATLAB, CIVA (Non Destructive Testing Simulation), A-Scan systems, Multichannel ultrasonic systems for immersion control, Ultrasound tomography systems, Phased arrays transducer 
      
  - role: Engineer (part-time)
    time: 2014-2015
    company: Tomsk Open Laboratory for Material Inspection (TOLMI), Institute of Nondestructive Testing (NDT), National Research Tomsk Polytechnic University (TPU), Russia
    details: |
      I investigated methods of nondestructive testing of heavy-loaded constructions. Specific approach based on principles of acoustic scattering in metals for determination of the case hardening depth was proposed, which is the main quality characteristic for the controlled objects. As a part of this experience I also undertook an internship at Saarland University (Saarbrücken, Germany) under the supervision of Michael Kroeining. He has been a scientific advisor of Tomsk Open Laboratory for Materials Inspection (TOLMI) since 2010, in a period from Oct. 2003 to Feb. 2009 he served as director of Fraunhofer Institute for Non-destructive Testing (Saarbrücken, Germany).<br>
