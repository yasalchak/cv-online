# Experience
experience:
  - role: PhD Student (full-time)
    time: 2018-Present
    company: Griffith University (Brisbane, Australia)
    details: |
      The project involves development of EM field propagation model for in-body to on-body wireless communication channel. <br> The validation includes numericall modeeling and  in-vivo experiments on laboratory animals. The validated model is implemented for 3D positioning of an implanted antenna based on RSSI analysis. Publications numbers included in the CV [1-7]
    technologies_used: | 
      MATLAB, CST MICROWAVE STUDIO®, Python, VNA, RF Spectrum Analyzer, Dream Catcher ME1310 (Radiation Pattern Software), Ultrasound imaging software <br>
      
      
  - role: Tutor for Research Methods & Statistics for Engineers (casual)
    time: 2018-2021
    company: Griffith University (Brisbane, Australia)
    details: |
      Giving tutorials on statistical data analysis and research methods, including sceintific design and project proposal preparation. <br>
      This experince also included giving several lectures to Master and Bachelor Students.

  - role: Researcher (full-time)
    time: 2015-2018
    company: Tomsk Open Laboratory for Material Inspection (TOLMI), Institute of Nondestructive Testing (NDT), National Research Tomsk Polytechnic University (TPU), Russia
    details: |
     Main research work included development of ultrasonic testing methodologies and instrument for quality assurance of steel elements with welding; perfomance evaluation of the acoustic systems for defects position esimation as well as its dimensions in order to enable objective evaluation of an item`s condition and its further service life;
     Implementation of algorithms for acoustic data visualization and 3D image reconstruction of welding defects. Systems based on digitally focused array (DFA) technology. <br>
     I investigated material degradation process and ways to characterize it by means of nondestructive testing techniques, and created the database that provides all necessary information for further automated quality assurance.<br>
     Experimental part of the research was performed using ultrasonic testing systems developed by TPU in collaboration with I-DEAL TECHNOLOGIES, GMBH Germany.<br>
     Some of the results of my work can be found in publications included in this document [8-13,15]
    technologies_used: | 
      MATLAB, CIVA (Non Destructive Testing Simulation), A-Scan systems, Multichannel ultrasonic systems for immersion control, Ultrasound tomography systems, Phased arrays transducer 
      
  - role: Engineer (part-time)
    time: 2014-2015
    company: Tomsk Open Laboratory for Material Inspection (TOLMI), Institute of Nondestructive Testing (NDT), National Research Tomsk Polytechnic University (TPU), Russia
    details: |
      I investigated methods of nondestructive testing of heavy-loaded constructions. Ultrasonic analysis was chosen as a method of research. Specific method based on principles of acoustic scattering in metals for determination of the case hardening depth was proposed, which is the main quality characteristic for the controlled objects.<br>
      As a part of this experience I also had an internship at Saarland University (Saarbrücken, Germany) under the supervision of Michael Kroeining.He has been a scientific advisor of Tomsk Open Laboratory for Materials Inspection (TOLMI) since 2010. In a period from Oct. 2003 to Feb. 2009 he served as director of Fraunhofer Institute for Non-destructive Testing (Saarbrücken, Germany).<br>
      As a part of this research a novel approach of multifunctional ultrasonic testing (UT) equipment was investigated. Case Depth Tester (P312), QNet was chosen as a specialized instrument for the reference measurements. SAPHIR_Quantum (AREVA) was chosen as a multifunctional instrument that can be used for the industrial UT nondestructive testing. Series of experiments were performed  to verify that the suggested method of ultrasonic measurement of case hardening depth can be applied with the multifunctional equipment of ultrasonic testing with the implementation of an additional algorithm of signal processing.
      The results can be found in publications numbers[14,16]
